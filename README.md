Visualization of Airline performance using BTS (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) database.

#### Data 
Procure the BTS data from [here.](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time)
Download monthly files that are needed to visualize (I have used the data that ranges from :June 2016- July2017). Utilize the lookup tables for features of the data. 

## Data Munging
Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.
Tool: Jupyter Notebook (Language: Python)

**Pandas** provide the necessary tools to perform data cleaning and munging for structured data. 

pandas can be installed via pip from [PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)

`pip install pandas`

If Anaconda distribution is installed then, install pandas as shown [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/pandas/)

The Jupyter Notebook can be found [here.](https://github.com/pavannaik3009/BusinessDataVisualization/blob/master/DataMunging.ipynb)

## Data Visualization
