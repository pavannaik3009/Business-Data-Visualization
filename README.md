# BusinessDataVisualization
Visualization of Airline performance using BTS (Bureau of Transportation Statistics) database.

#### Data 
Procure the BTS data from [here.](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time)
Download monthly files that are needed to visualize (I have used the data that ranges from :June 2016- July2017). Utilize the lookup tables for features of the data. 

## Data Munging
Jupyter Notebook (Language: Python)

**Pandas** provide the necessary tools to perform data cleaning and munging for structured data. 

pandas can be installed via pip from [PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
`pip install pandas`

If Anaconda distribution is installed then, install pandas as shown [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/pandas/)

The Jupyter Notebook can be found [here.](https://github.com/pavannaik3009/BusinessDataVisualization/blob/master/DataMunging.ipynb)
